# Youtube Clone Application

This is a clone of Youtube, the popular video sharing website. This project has most of the same features such as the search functionality, channel details and all the channel's videos and related videos.

Things I learned or practiced in this project:

- Used Material UI for the building of the user interface for this project.
- Used Axios to fetch the information I needed consuming RapidAPI for all my data.
- Used the same component (ChannelCard.jsx) in multiple places and edited it to fit my needs. This showed me the benefit of coding in React in particular because of it's reusable components.
- I also learned how to actually play videos in React applications in this project using the ReactPlayer component.
- I also learned how to use the UseParams hook from React Router DOM to capture the information that's presented in the url e.g. the query parameter.
- Instead of using if else statements which is what I'm used to I've learned about && and || operators to improve my code.
